## About the game

I know I'm an speccy person. But It was too strong the temptation to do it on 320x200 with 8 sprites like an Mocodore 64.  :-DDD

I've also simulated the 64 SID sound with ADSR wave definitions.

Maybe I will create some fun version for spectrum (or spectrum next), mocodore or for super-modern super-computers like the raspberry with raylib.
